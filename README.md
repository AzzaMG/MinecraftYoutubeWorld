# Minecraft Youtube World
This is snapshots of the Minecraft world we built during live streams together

## Where do I get the world?
 - You can download it from the [releases section](https://github.com/ash47/MinecraftYoutubeWorld/releases)

## How do I use it?
 - You need the Java version of Minecraft
 - Download the latest release of the map (200MB+)
 - Open your Minecraft save directory
   - Windows: Press `Windows + R`, then type `%appdata%\.minecraft`, then press Ok.
   - OS X: In the Finder, from the Go menu, select `Go to Folder`, then type: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`, and click Go.
   - Linux: `~` is your home directory, usually `/home/YOURNAME`, so `~/.minecraft` would be `/home/YOURNAME/.minecraft/`.
 - Extract the `AzzaFortysix` folder directory into your `.minecraft/saves` directory.
 - You should now have `.minecraft/saves/AzzaFortysix/level.dat`.
 - Launch Minecraft
 - Select Singleplayer
 - Launch the AzzaFortysix map
